## Inspiration
### Theme : 
Smart Habitat What we understand by smart habitat? Habitat is a place that human adapts himself to. Keeping this in mind we started to work on our idea to deal the problems related to traffic congestion and accidents.

## What it does
Let's explain our idea with an illustration. Suppose you go to your college nearly 5/7 days, You choose the same route, one day you realize that there is some accident happened on the road because of which the road is jammed and now you think, I wish somebody would have told me about this earlier when I was leaving my home, I would have chosen another route. This is majorly what we are doing, We will tell the user few minutes before he leaves, that the usual route he takes will lead him to jam and open maps for him to choose a better route. We are making this possible by the use of android, APIs and Machine Learning which will help us predict the road accidents or any mis-happening leading to jam by image processing. Machine learning will predict that chaos on roads is due to accidents or maybe because of some other reason. Secondly, In case of accident we will message the nearby hospitals about the accident with an image so that fastest help can be reach at that place. Thirdly, We are also detecting the number of cars in the jam by machine learning which will help us predict that how much time extra will it take than usual to cross that signal. 
Uniqueness/Originality: The idea is unique and is not yet implemented in India. 
Feasibility: The solution is feasible, as by putting very less efforts this idea can be practically applied for the greater good. 
Cost Of Implementation: The major cost to make this idea working is in setting cameras. Moreover Rs 60,000 crore is lost every year, including fuel, due to traffic delays on high volume highways.(source: NDTV). So setting up cameras can inculcate that every year's baggage cost. Above all it will help to save someone's life and cost of someone's life is priceless. 
Effectiveness Of Idea: The idea is effective as every person has their phones and check them before going to their workplace. 
Implementation Completeness: The project is nearly complete. There is still need to add the feature-Extra time taken to go through this path in android app although it is fully completed and working. In addition to this iOS frontend for the same app is completed with impressive UX. To give nearby hospitals message still permission is need to be taken. In all there is a working android application with main features just extra features are needed to be added.

## How We built it
With great efforts and dedication. The technologies used are: Android, Django, OpenCV- Image Processing, Keras, iOS

## Challenges We ran into
Finding Data set, Downloading large data sets over internet, Find right APIs and understanding them was a bit of a task

## Accomplishments that We're proud of
We are very proud to nearly complete our idea in this short span. Working all night without sleep and coming up with a product that can help society is what makes us proud. If this idea started using by govt. an even one life can be saved because of which we will be more than proud that anyone can think.

## What We learned
If you want to do something only you are the person stopping yourself.

## What's next for Smart Traffic
The cameras installed at red lights can be used to fine the drivers who are without seat belts or helmets i.e. it can produce revenue for the government. The cameras installed can check illegally parked cars on the road and an image can be send to the nearest police station so that they can be towed or fined accordingly.
